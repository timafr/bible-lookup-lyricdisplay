# Repository and Architecture Map

This is the contributor's map of LyricDisplay. Use it to identify the process that owns a behavior, find the first files to read, and understand which adjacent contracts must change with it.

For setup, code conventions, and pull request expectations, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md). HTTP and realtime protocol details live in [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml) and [`asyncapi.yaml`](asyncapi.yaml).

## System at a Glance

LyricDisplay is one product with four runtime layers:

    Electron["Electron main process\nmain.js + main/"]
    Preload["Preload boundary\npreload.js + preloads/"]
    Renderer["React renderer\nsrc/"]
    Backend["Express + Socket.IO child process\nserver/"]
    Shared["Shared contracts and parsing\nshared/"]
    Outputs["Output, stage, timer, OBS,\nand remote browser clients"]

```

- The **Electron main process** owns native capabilities: windows, displays, filesystem dialogs, secure storage, update/install flows, MIDI/OSC, NDI companion management, and application lifecycle.
- The **preload layer** is the security boundary between browser code and Electron. Renderer code must use the APIs exposed on `window.electronAPI`; Node integration is disabled.
- The **React renderer** owns the control panel, editors, output views, local UI state, and client-side socket synchronization.
- The **backend** is the authoritative realtime session and network boundary. It authenticates clients, applies permissions and safety checks, stores live session state, serves media/API routes, and broadcasts state to displays.
- The **shared layer** contains environment-neutral parsing, limits, registries, reconciliation, and contract constants used by two or more runtime layers.

### Development and packaged topology

| Concern | Development | Packaged application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Renderer URL | Vite on `http://localhost:5173` | Backend serves `dist/` on `http://127.0.0.1:4000` |
| Router | `BrowserRouter` | `BrowserRouter` |
| Backend | Electron forks `server/index.js` with `NODE_ENV=development` | Electron forks the ASAR-packaged backend with `NODE_ENV=production` and a real `userData` working directory |
| API/socket access | Vite proxies `/api`, `/socket.io`, and `/media` to port `4000`; Electron renderers resolve port `4000` directly | Same origin as the backend-served renderer |
| Native bridge | Electron windows only | Electron windows only |
| Persistent profile | Isolated `LyricDisplay-Dev` Electron, Chromium, backend, and credential namespaces | Production `LyricDisplay` profile with legacy-data migration |

The backend is a separate npm package with its own [`server/package.json`](../server/package.json) and lockfile. A clean checkout therefore needs both root and server dependencies installed. Backend production dependencies are also listed in the root manifest so electron-builder can package and resolve them beside the ASAR-hosted server; keep the two manifests aligned when those dependencies change. The optional `lyricdisplay-ndi/` directory is a separately cloned, ignored repository, not part of this repository's tracked tree.

Development and packaged profiles can coexist on disk, but they intentionally retain the same backend and external-control ports and therefore are not supported concurrently. Backend readiness probes carry a per-child challenge so one profile cannot mistake the other profile's running backend for its own.

Electron-builder smart-unpacks the native runtime modules required by the packaged app. Packaging filters remove compiler sources and intermediate build products from `better-sqlite3` and `@julusian/midi`, but retain their runtime `.node` binaries and published prebuilds for each target platform.

Windows upgrades intentionally retain electron-builder's default atomic NSIS replacement flow: the old installation directory is removed while app data is kept, then the new payload is installed. Do not define a custom NSIS `customRemoveFiles` macro without preserving that complete replacement behavior. macOS application bundles and Linux AppImages likewise keep packaged code separate from user data. Release and platform-test workflows run [`scripts/verify-packaged-runtime.js`](../scripts/verify-packaged-runtime.js) on each operating system before accepting an artifact.

```

Generated or machine-local paths are `node_modules/`, `server/node_modules/`, `dist/`, `release/`, `out/`, `uploads/`, logs, and the optional `lyricdisplay-ndi/` clone. The files inside `build/` are tracked packaging inputs and should be changed when installer behavior changes. Run `npm run generate:appx-assets` after changing the source icon; it regenerates the transparent, theme-aware Windows assets in `build/appx/` and the Partner Center upload image in `build/store/`.

## Entry Points and Startup

### Electron startup

1. [`main.js`](../main.js) establishes app identity and the custom media scheme, takes the single-instance lock, initializes file logging, registers IPC, and wires protocol/file-open lifecycle events.
2. [`main/startup.js`](../main/startup.js) starts the backend, obtains the backend-generated admin key, prewarms providers/fonts, initializes display/NDI/external-control services, and creates the main window.
3. [`main/backend.js`](../main/backend.js) forks [`server/index.js`](../server/index.js), passes the user-data paths and app-session ID, waits for health readiness, mirrors logs, and applies bounded restart recovery.
4. [`main/windows.js`](../main/windows.js) creates secured `BrowserWindow` instances and loads either the Vite route or the backend-served clean route.
5. [`src/main.jsx`](../src/main.jsx) initializes the persisted Zustand store, chunk recovery, global styles, and the React root. [`src/App.jsx`](../src/App.jsx) selects the router and route tree.

Headless OBS Dock mode follows the same backend startup but deliberately skips creating renderer windows. Its relaunch/protocol behavior is owned by [`main/obsDockStartup.js`](../main/obsDockStartup.js), [`main/tray.js`](../main/tray.js), and the app-control backend route.

### Renderer routes

The source of truth is [`src/App.jsx`](../src/App.jsx). Custom output routes are bounded by [`shared/outputRegistry.js`](../shared/outputRegistry.js), currently `output3` through `output6` in addition to the two default outputs.

| Route | Main component | Runtime role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `components/LyricDisplayApp.jsx` | Primary operator UI; wrapped in the control socket provider and desktop shell when applicable |
| `/?dock=obs` and `/obs-dock` | `components/ObsDockLayout.jsx` | Compact OBS dock controller using an `obsDock` client identity |
| `/new-song` | `components/NewSongCanvas.jsx` | Lyrics authoring/editor workflow |
| `/lyric-video-studio` | `pages/LyricVideoStudio.jsx` | Timeline, preview, style, and export UI |
| `/output1`, `/output2` | `pages/OutputPage.jsx` | Default socket-driven lyric outputs selected by route-provided output ID |
| `/output3` ... `/output6` | `pages/OutputPage.jsx` | Custom socket-driven lyric outputs |
| `/stage` | `pages/Stage.jsx` | Stage display: current/next/previous lyrics, timer, messages, upcoming song |
| `/time` | `pages/TimeDisplay.jsx` | Dedicated timer/clock projection |
| `/timer-control` | `components/TimerControlModule.jsx` | Dedicated authoritative timer controller |
| `/obs-setup` | `pages/ObsSetup.jsx` | OBS WebSocket/source creation UI |
| `/lyric-video-live-output` | `pages/LyricVideoLiveOutput.jsx` | Live visual output from the video studio state |
| `/lyric-video-export-frame` | `pages/LyricVideoExportFrame.jsx` | Capture-only export renderer with no preload |

Passive display routes skip the global modal/toast providers. Output, stage, time, and live-video windows receive the restricted passive preload; the export frame receives no preload. This policy is defined in [`main/windowSecurity.js`](../main/windowSecurity.js).

## Electron Main Process Map

### Orchestration, windows, and lifecycle

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`main.js`](../main.js) | Composition root for lifecycle, IPC, menus, backend messages, single-instance behavior, tray behavior, protocol/file launches, and cleanup |
| [`main/startup.js`](../main/startup.js) | Ordered application startup and degraded backend-start handling |
| [`main/backend.js`](../main/backend.js) | Backend child-process lifecycle, readiness checks, IPC messages, log mirroring, restart policy |
| [`main/windows.js`](../main/windows.js) | BrowserWindow creation, route loading, navigation restrictions, crash recovery, window diagnostics |
| [`main/windowSecurity.js`](../main/windowSecurity.js) | Route-to-preload-role policy |
| [`main/singleInstance.js`](../main/singleInstance.js) | Single-instance lock and second-launch dispatch |
| [`main/fileHandler.js`](../main/fileHandler.js) | OS file association and pending-open handling |
| [`main/lyricFiles.js`](../main/lyricFiles.js) | Canonical path validation, extraction, recent-file updates, and write grants for local lyric files |
| [`main/fileNavigator.js`](../main/fileNavigator.js) | Persistent indexed roots, filesystem watching, search records, previews, and safe browse/open resolution |
| [`main/menuBridge.js`](../main/menuBridge.js) | Native menu construction and renderer menu events |
| [`main/modalBridge.js`](../main/modalBridge.js) | Promise-based requests from main process to renderer modals |
| [`main/tray.js`](../main/tray.js) | Desktop/headless system tray |
| [`main/cleanup.js`](../main/cleanup.js) | Central shutdown cleanup for backend, displays, external control, and NDI |
| [`main/paths.js`](../main/paths.js) | Development vs unpacked production path resolution |
| [`main/appIdentity.js`](../main/appIdentity.js) | Stable Electron app identity and user-data migration |

### Displays and projection

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [`main/displayManager.js`](../main/displayManager.js) | Electron display inventory, assignments, persistence, and moving windows to displays |
| [`main/displayDetection.js`](../main/displayDetection.js) | Display-add/remove detection and startup/user prompts |
| [`main/ipc/display.js`](../main/ipc/display.js) | Projection window creation/teardown, display queries, output and utility windows |
| [`main/loadingWindow.js`](../main/loadingWindow.js) | Restricted startup progress window |
| [`main/progressWindow.js`](../main/progressWindow.js) | Restricted update/download progress window |
| [`main/inAppBrowser.js`](../main/inAppBrowser.js) | Sandboxed in-app browser and URL/navigation IPC |

### IPC organization

[`main/ipc/index.js`](../main/ipc/index.js) is the registration hub; domain ownership is below it.

| Domain file | Renderer capability |
| --- | --- |
| `app.js` | Theme, version/log paths, relaunch, OBS Dock startup |
| `auth.js` | Desktop JWT, join code, connection diagnostics, secure token store |
| `display.js` | Display inventory, projection, output/timer/OBS setup windows |
| `files.js` | Lyric open/save/parse and lyric-video audio grants |
| `fileNavigator.js` | Indexed-root management, browse/search/preview, batch selection, and reveal/open operations |
| `recents.js` | Recent-file list and open behavior |
| `lyrics.js` | Online provider discovery, credentials, search, fetch, cancellation |
| `easyworship.js` | EasyWorship database validation and import |
| `presentation.js` | Presentation bundle validation and import |
| `setlist.js` | `.ldset` save/load/browse/export |
| `templates.js` | Output/stage template CRUD |
| `preferences.js` | Preference categories, migrations, defaults, and path browsing |
| `updater.js` | Check, download, install, session policy, progress window |
| `lyricVideoExport.js` | FFmpeg readiness/selection, frame capture, video export, cancellation |
| `security.js` | JWT status and rotation/restart |
| `window.js` | Window chrome, fullscreen, reload/devtools/zoom, undo/redo menu state |
| `misc.js` | Fonts, local IP, and in-app browser launch |
| `senderValidation.js` | Trusted sender/URL checks used to protect IPC and navigation |

When adding IPC, update all three surfaces: a domain handler in `main/ipc/` (or the owning integration module), the smallest appropriate preload API, and the renderer caller. Keep payload validation and sender validation in the main process.

### Native feature modules

| Area | Files |
| --- | --- |
| Preferences and local data | `userPreferences.js`, `preferenceMigrations.js`, `themePreferences.js`, `recents.js`, `userTemplates.js` |
| Secure data | `secureTokenStore.js`, `providerCredentials.js`, `adminKey.js` |
| Setlists/imports | `setlistFileStorage.js`, `setlistValidation.js`, `setlistExport.js`, `easyWorship.js`, `presentation.js` |
| Online lyrics | `lyricsProviders/index.js`, provider adapters under `lyricsProviders/providers/`, cache/reliability/search helpers alongside them |
| MIDI/OSC | `externalControl.js`, `externalControlCorrelation.js`, `midiController.js`, `oscController.js`, `oscSecurity.js` |
| NDI | `ndiManager.js` plus installer, IPC client, and settings modules under `main/ndi/` |
| Updates | `updater.js`, `updateSessionPolicy.js`, `progressWindow.js` |
| Diagnostics | `logging.js`, `batchedLogWriter.js`, `logRetention.js` |
| Lyric video | `lyricVideoMediaProtocol.js`, `ipc/lyricVideoExport.js` |
| Other OS integration | `systemFonts.js`, `obsDockStartup.js`, `devServer.js`, `utils.js` |

## Preload Security Boundary

[`preload.js`](../preload.js) exposes the full `window.electronAPI` used by control-capable windows. Its namespaces include token storage, lyric video, security, OBS Dock startup, window controls, recents, lyrics providers, EasyWorship, presentations, displays, setlists, templates, external control, MIDI, OSC, NDI, and preferences.

Restricted preloads in [`preloads/`](../preloads/) exist for narrow window roles:

| File | Allowed surface |
| --- | --- |
| `passive.cjs` | Token read, fullscreen toggle, preference reads for output/stage/time views |
| `browser.cjs` | In-app browser navigation only |
| `loading.cjs` | Startup status events only |
| `updater.cjs` | Updater state and actions only |

Do not import Node or Electron modules into `src/`. If renderer code needs a native operation, add a validated main-process handler and expose the minimum API required. Projection windows should not gain the full control preload without a deliberate security review.

## Backend Map

### Bootstrap and HTTP

[`server/index.js`](../server/index.js) creates secrets and token services, builds media paths, restores persisted session state, registers middleware/routes/socket authentication, optionally serves `dist/`, and sends readiness to Electron.

```text
server/
|-- auth/                    # JWT issuance/verification, permissions, join code, OBS pairing
|-- config/                  # Valid client type definitions
|-- media/                   # Upload validation, filenames, directories, media services
|-- middleware/              # CORS and loopback-only guards
|-- realtime/                # Authoritative state, persistence, safety, broadcasts, handlers
|-- routes/                  # Express route registration by domain
|-- security/                # Secret generation, rotation, keychain/encrypted fallback
|-- events.js                # Socket handler composition root
|-- index.js                 # Backend process entry
|-- package.json             # Backend-only dependencies/scripts
`-- package-lock.json        # Backend dependency lock
```

HTTP route ownership:

| Route module | Main endpoint family |
| --- | --- |
| `routes/auth.js` | `/api/auth/token`, refresh/validate, join code, OBS Dock token |
| `routes/outputs.js` | Output registry and per-output availability |
| `routes/integrations.js` | Integration/browser-source URLs |
| `routes/media.js` | Background uploads and user media list/upload/delete |
| `routes/templates.js` | Local template reads used by browser clients |
| `routes/connection.js` | Authenticated connected-client diagnostics |
| `routes/health.js` | Liveness, readiness, and privileged details |
| `routes/adminSecrets.js` | Local secret status/rotation |
| `routes/appControl.js` | Loopback desktop/dock mode switching and quit |

The exact public schemas belong in [`docs/openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml). When changing an audited endpoint, also update [`shared/apiContractRegistry.js`](../shared/apiContractRegistry.js) and the contract tests/checker.

### Realtime ownership

[`server/events.js`](../server/events.js) is a composition root. Actual event logic lives in `server/realtime/handlers/`:

| Handler | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `connectionHandlers.js` | Client registration, heartbeat, disconnect, current/periodic snapshots |
| `lyricsHandlers.js` | Line selection, lyric loads, timestamp/section grouping updates, filename and autoplay state |
| `outputHandlers.js` | Global/per-output toggles, styles, output registry, metrics, removal |
| `setlistHandlers.js` | Add/remove/update/load/clear/reorder/replace |
| `stageHandlers.js` | Authoritative timer changes and stage messages |
| `draftHandlers.js` | Remote lyric draft submit/approve/reject |
| `liveSafetyHandlers.js` | Live-safety state and blocking responses |
| `actionLogHandlers.js` | Privileged operator action-log snapshots and clear |

Supporting realtime modules:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `state.js` | In-memory authoritative lyrics, selection, outputs, stage, timer, setlist, clients, drafts, registry, and safety state |
| `broadcast.js` | Permission/client-aware broadcast helpers |
| `sessionPersistence.js` | Debounced schema-versioned state snapshot and restore |
| `setlistValidation.js` | Size, shape, and count validation for socket setlist payloads |
| `timerScheduler.js` | Server-side timer boundary scheduling |
| `liveSafety.js` | Safety policy enforcement for mutating live actions |
| `actionLog.js` | Bounded audit history |
| `stateDiagnostics.js` | Health/diagnostic summaries without exposing sensitive state |
| `utils.js` | Plain-object, size, permission, and normalization helpers |

The backend accepts authenticated client types defined in `server/config/clientTypes.js`: desktop, web, OBS Dock, output clients, stage, and mobile. Permissions are assigned in `server/auth/permissions.js`; all mutating handlers must enforce the relevant permission and live-safety rule before changing state.

### Backend data and media

In Electron, [`main/backend.js`](../main/backend.js) sets `LYRICDISPLAY_DATA_DIR` to `<Electron userData>/backend`. The backend stores its realtime snapshot and uploaded media beneath that root. Development uses the persistent `LyricDisplay-Dev` profile while packaged builds use `LyricDisplay`, so development state and Chromium storage cannot alter installed state. User-authored and imported files beneath Documents remain shared intentionally. When `server/index.js` is launched directly without that environment variable, it falls back to the repository root, which is why development `uploads/` is ignored.

Authentication secrets prefer the OS keychain and use an encrypted platform config fallback. Renderer auth/provider tokens likewise prefer secure main-process storage. Development appends `-Dev` to credential-vault services and platform fallback roots; production names remain unchanged. Never add secrets, admin keys, raw JWTs, or user-data paths to logs or socket payloads.

```

### Components

- [`components/LyricDisplayApp.jsx`](../src/components/LyricDisplayApp.jsx) is the control-panel feature coordinator. Its extracted view pieces are in `components/LyricDisplayApp/`; orchestration behavior belongs in `hooks/LyricDisplayApp/`.
- [`components/LyricsList.jsx`](../src/components/LyricsList.jsx), `components/LyricsList/`, and `hooks/LyricsList/` own virtualized lyric rows, selection, grouping, history, context menus, and section navigation.
- [`components/NewSongCanvas.jsx`](../src/components/NewSongCanvas.jsx), `components/NewSongCanvas/`, and `hooks/NewSongCanvas/` own authoring, clipboard/history, search, measurements, timestamps, drafts, and saving.
- [`components/OutputSettingsPanel.jsx`](../src/components/OutputSettingsPanel.jsx), its directory, and `hooks/OutputSettingsPanel/` own output styling controls. Shared output rendering belongs in [`components/output/LyricVisualFrame.jsx`](../src/components/output/LyricVisualFrame.jsx).
- `components/LyricVideoStudio/` plus the lyric-video pages/utilities own preview, transport, timeline, styling, and export UX.
- `components/UserPreferencesModal/` and its hooks own preference editing; its indexed-folder page manages navigator sources through the file-navigator IPC, while ordinary preference persistence crosses preload IPC into `main/userPreferences.js`.
- `components/routes/` decides which routes get the control socket provider and desktop shell.
- `components/bridges/` converts Electron events into renderer modals/actions without coupling feature components directly to raw IPC listeners.
- `components/modal/`, `components/toast/`, and `components/ui/` are reusable infrastructure. Add primitives here instead of cloning controls inside a feature.

### State ownership

[`src/context/LyricsStore.js`](../src/context/LyricsStore.js) composes a persisted Zustand store. Prefer the narrow selectors in [`src/hooks/useStoreSelectors.js`](../src/hooks/useStoreSelectors.js) rather than subscribing a component to the full store.

| Slice | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `lyricsStore/lyricsSessionSlice.js` | Parsed/raw lyrics, selection, filename/source, sections, metadata, timestamps, pending saved version |
| `lyricsStore/outputSlice.js` | Master output state, default/custom output settings, enabled flags, custom output registry |
| `lyricsStore/stageSlice.js` | Stage enabled state and visual settings |
| `lyricsStore/timerSlice.js` | Timer controller settings and timer-display style settings |
| `lyricsStore/setlistSlice.js` | Setlist items, modal state, configurable item limit |
| `lyricsStore/autoplaySlice.js` | Autoplay defaults and onboarding state |
| `lyricsStore/preferencesSlice.js` | Renderer-facing formatting/tutorial/file-size preferences |
| `lyricsStore/appShellSlice.js` | Theme, welcome state, and desktop-runtime detection |

This store is both UI state and a local persistence cache. The backend remains authoritative for the connected live session. On first desktop connection, [`shared/sessionReconciliation.js`](../shared/sessionReconciliation.js) determines whether persisted desktop state may bootstrap an empty backend session; otherwise incoming backend snapshots win.

[`src/context/ControlSocketProvider.jsx`](../src/context/ControlSocketProvider.jsx) provides the long-lived controller socket and typed emitter helpers. [`src/hooks/useSocket.js`](../src/hooks/useSocket.js) is used by output/stage/time clients. Both delegate incoming state application to [`src/hooks/useSocketEvents.js`](../src/hooks/useSocketEvents.js) and connection throttling to [`src/utils/connectionManager.js`](../src/utils/connectionManager.js).

### Utility boundaries

- Put logic shared by Electron, server, worker, and renderer in `shared/`, not `src/utils/`.
- `src/utils/asyncLyricsParser.js` chooses Electron IPC, browser worker, or synchronous parsing based on runtime and format.
- `src/utils/parseLyrics.js`, `lyricsFormat.js`, `lyricLineNavigation.js`, and timestamp helpers adapt parsed lyric data for UI behavior.
- `src/utils/network.js`, `clientType.js`, `secureTokenStore.js`, and `connectionManager.js` own renderer network/auth connection details.
- `src/utils/maxLinesCalculator.js`, `paint.js`, `outputLabels.js`, and `outputTemplates.js` support output presentation/settings.
- `src/utils/timerUtils.js` supports renderer display/control calculations; authoritative validation/revision logic belongs in `shared/timerAuthority.js` and server realtime modules.
- `src/utils/logger.js` is the renderer logging facade. Keep sensitive values out of all log calls.

## Shared Modules Map

`shared/` must remain usable in its target environments. Avoid Electron, DOM, or Express imports here unless a file is explicitly environment-specific.

| File or directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `lyricsParsing/` | Text/LRC parsing, cleanup, grouping, translation, structure tags, sections, line splitting, runtime config |
| `documentTextExtraction.js` | Markdown/RTF/DOCX extraction and unified import parsing |
| `lyricImportRegistry.js` | Supported extensions, parser types, labels, accept strings, dialog filters |
| `lyricImportLimits.js` | Import and extracted-document size limits |
| `fileNavigatorSearch.js` | Normalization, query filters, typo-tolerant relevance scoring, LRC previews, and match snippets |
| `outputRegistry.js` | Default output IDs, custom-output count, routable IDs |
| `setlistLimits.js` | Setlist count, payload, item, and string limits |
| `timerAuthority.js` | Revisioned timer validation, clock localization, boundary advancement |
| `sessionReconciliation.js` | Desktop persisted-state vs backend-session bootstrap policy |
| `commandSafetyPolicy.js` | Focus/live-safety policy for operator commands |
| `apiContractRegistry.js` | Audited REST/realtime names and permissions |
| `productionReadiness.js` | Output, projection, and NDI pre-service health evaluation |
| `data/knownArtists.json` | Artist detection data |
| `data/openhymnal-*.json` | Bundled OpenHymnal provider data/sample |

If a limit, event name, output ID, timer shape, or parser behavior is consumed in multiple layers, define or normalize it here and import it at every boundary.

       Browser: Web Worker -> shared parser
       Fallback: shared parser in renderer
  -> Zustand lyrics session slice
  -> ControlSocketProvider emits lyricsLoad / lineUpdate
  -> server/realtime/handlers/lyricsHandlers.js validates and updates state.js
  -> server broadcasts role-appropriate state/events
  -> useSocketEvents updates each client store
  -> OutputPage or Stage renders the selected line
```

When changing this flow, check import limits/format registry, parser result shape, renderer store setters, socket payload validation, session persistence, and output/stage readers.

### Save lyrics

```text
Canvas Save / Save & Load
  -> compact indexed-folder save navigator
  -> preload -> main/ipc/fileNavigator.js validates the destination and grants the write
       Optional: Save in different folder -> native Save As dialog
  -> main/ipc/files.js writes TXT/LRC and refreshes the navigator index
  -> recent files and the active setlist copy are refreshed
```

### Change an output style

```text
OutputSettingsPanel
  -> output selector/action in Zustand
  -> control socket styleUpdate
  -> outputHandlers.js validates output + permissions + live safety
  -> authoritative outputSettings map
  -> styleUpdate broadcast
  -> output client store
  -> LyricVisualFrame
  -> outputMetrics back to server/control panel
```

Style fields therefore have at least four consumers: defaults/state, settings controls, server synchronization, and visual rendering. Template serialization and pre-service readiness may be additional consumers.

### Project an output

```text
control panel action
  -> window.electronAPI.display
  -> main/ipc/display.js
  -> displayManager assignment
  -> windows.createWindow('/outputN', projection options)
  -> passive preload + output socket client
  -> metrics reported to the control panel
```

Projection changes should be checked on display reconnect/removal, custom-output deletion, crash recovery, fullscreen/focus behavior, and packaged routes.

### Authenticate and connect

```text
renderer client type + device/session ID
  -> useAuth / secure token store
  -> /api/auth token, refresh, or OBS pairing route
  -> signed JWT with client permissions
  -> Socket.IO auth middleware
  -> connectionHandlers client registration
  -> role-filtered currentState snapshot
```

Desktop credentials cross from backend child to Electron over process IPC and are never sent to arbitrary browser clients. Web/mobile controllers use the join-code flow; OBS Dock has pairing/local-headless flows. Output/stage clients receive read-oriented permissions.

## API and Contract Discipline

- Realtime implementation lives in `server/realtime/handlers/`, not in the `server/events.js` composition file.
- Keep event payload changes aligned across controller emitters, server validation/state, receiver handlers, session snapshots, and [`docs/asyncapi.yaml`](asyncapi.yaml).
- Keep REST changes aligned across the route, caller, authentication middleware, [`docs/openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml), and audited registry where applicable.
- Preserve role-filtered state in `server/realtime/state.js`; output/stage clients should not receive control-only or sensitive session data.
- Avoid introducing a second constant for a cross-layer limit or identifier. Move the source of truth into `shared/`.

## Tests, Checks, and Release Files

The project uses Node's built-in test runner. Test filenames generally mirror their owning module or contract.

| Change area | Useful checks |
| --- | --- |
| Any source change | `npm run check:static`, `npm run test:unit` |
| REST/realtime contract | `npm run check:contracts`, `tests/api-contracts.test.js` |
| Parsing/imports/providers | parsing/import/provider/search tests; optional `npm run test:lyrics-canary` makes live provider requests |
| Auth/IPC/preload/security | auth, information-exposure, IPC sender, preload-boundary, secret-storage, security-hardening tests |
| Outputs/displays/session | display-recovery, setlist-output-state, session-reconciliation, state-diagnostics tests |
| Timer | timer-authority and timer-utils tests |
| NDI/external control | NDI installer/client/settings/CLI, external-control, OSC security tests |
| Renderer/package integration | `npm run build`; package workflows under `.github/workflows/` |

[`scripts/check-static.js`](../scripts/check-static.js) checks syntax/import hygiene and invokes API contract validation. Other scripts write build metadata, update versions/docs, verify update blockmaps, register the development protocol, and drive releases. Tag-based multi-platform release behavior is defined in [`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/build-release.yml); manual packaging verification is in `test-platform-builds.yml`.

Documentation-only changes do not require starting a dev server. For behavior changes, use the narrowest relevant checks first, then the root static/unit suite and production renderer build before handoff.

## Keeping This Map Current

Update this document when a change:

- adds, removes, or relocates an entry point, route, domain folder, or process boundary;
- moves authoritative state or persistence ownership;
- introduces a new IPC, HTTP, Socket.IO, protocol, or companion-app surface;
- adds a cross-layer source of truth under `shared/`;
- changes generated, runtime, tracked packaging, or separately cloned directories; or
- changes the recommended first files for a feature area.

The map should describe current code ownership. User-facing setup belongs in [`INSTALLATION.md`](../INSTALLATION.md), contribution policy belongs in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and wire-level schemas belong in the OpenAPI/AsyncAPI documents.
